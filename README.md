# Logistics Mock API

This is a mocked logistics API that provides some endpoints for testing and proof-of-concept purposes.
The API contains fake data and can simulate random timeouts on some requests.

So, you will observe that this project is not following the best practices (at this first moment), once the only purpose is publish a docker image that will be useful for another POC on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/renanpelicari).

For more information about this project and the repository as well, ou can check it through this link: [https://github.com/renanpelicari/logistics-mock-api](https://github.com/renanpelicari/logistics-mock-api)
